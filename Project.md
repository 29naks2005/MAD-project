1. Project Title
LocalLink – Hyperlocal Service Finder App

2. Name
Nakul Sharma 

3. Problem Statement
Finding trusted and nearby service providers like plumbers, electricians, or tutors can be time-consuming and inconvenient. People often rely on word-of-mouth or random online listings, which may be outdated, unreliable, or far from their location. There is a need for a platform that quickly connects users with verified local service providers within a short distance.

4. Proposed Solution / Idea
LocalLink is a React Native mobile app that uses GPS to locate and list service providers within a 5 km radius. Service providers can register, list their skills, prices, and contact details. Users can search for specific services, view nearby providers, and connect instantly. The app stores all data securely using Firebase, ensuring fast and reliable access to local help.

5. Key Features

User sign-up and login with Firebase Authentication

Service provider profile creation (Name, Skill, Price, Contact, Photo)

GPS location detection and storage

List of providers within a 5 km radius

Search by skill/service type (e.g., plumber, tutor)

Simple and fast interface for quick access

6. Target Users / Audience

7. Technology Stack

Frontend: React Native

Backend & Database: Firebase Firestore

Location Services: GPS + Geofirestore for radius filtering

8. Expected Outcome
A functional mobile app that allows users to find and connect with verified service providers near their location in under a minute, improving convenience and supporting local workers.
